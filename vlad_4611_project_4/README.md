Implemented heirarchical recursive bone rendering with spheres at tips of boneVectors and rotation matrices that connect these spheres with properly oriented unitCylinderZ()
Rotation matrices are generated by dotting bone vector with z axis, and rotating this about a cross vector.
Implemented Cubic Hermite spline interpolation for path->getValue() and it's derivative for path->getDerivative()
Placed and oriented character along spline.
Implemented animation speed changing that takes the length of the path->getDerivative() vector and scales the animation delta times accordingly.

EXTRA:
[Debug Feature] drew future position    line and sphere for debugging (yellow)
[Debug Feature] drew derivative vectore line and sphere for debugging (red)
